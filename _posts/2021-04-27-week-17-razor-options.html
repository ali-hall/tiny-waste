      <h2>Safety Razor</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/17-razors/leaf-razor.jpg" alt="4 leaf brand safety razors in different colors">
      <p>
        You probably haven't seen a safety razor since your grandfather's day, but thanks to their 
        sustainable ?? they are making a huge comeback. While there are many safety razors on the 
        market, <a href="https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-razor" target="__blank">The Leaf Razor</a> 
        is easily the most popular thanks to it's pivoting head and multi-blade system. At $85, it is 
        among some of the pricier options. However, it has a lifetime guarantee, so you should never 
        have to replace it. If you do have to dispose of your Leaf Razor for any reason, both the body 
        and the blades are 100% recyclable with metals, although you may have to find a spot that accepts scrap metal. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite ready to spend big on a safety razor? <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/albatross-flagship-3-piece-razor" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a> offers a more traditional model for $25. While this is still more expensive than 
        a disposable razor, remember that you'll save a significant amount of cash and plastic waste in the long run. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Whichever safety razor you end up with, you can collect the used blades and send them to <a href="https://albatrossdesigns.it/pages/albatross-blade-take-back-program" target="__blank">
        The Albatross Blade Take Back Program</a>. For details on how to participate, head to their website.
      </p>

      <p>
        The one drawback to safety razors is that they aren't allowed on planes. Normally I recommend using 
        what you have and only replacing it when necessary. However, in this case, it's best to save your 
        disposable razors for travel.

      <h2 class="highlight">Shaving Soap</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/17-razors/shaving-soap.jpg" alt="round bar of shaving soap">
      <p>
        Shaving cream containers may be recyclable, but because theey are aerosols, they release chemicals that 
        contribute to global warming into the atmosphere. A more sustainable option is a shaving soap bar 
        like this one for $10 from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/amber-ale-shave-body-bar" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a>.

      <h2 class="highlight">Shaving Brush</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/17-razors/shaving-brush.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        You obviously don't have to use a shaving brush, but if that's your method of choice, opt for a wooden handle with natural bristles.
        I like this $12 one from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/758286500/natural-shaving-brush-zero-waste-100?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=compostable+shave+brush&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1">
        Brooklyn Made Natural</a> because it is made of 100% biodegradable materials.

      <h2 class="highlight">After Shave</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/17-razors/aftershave-tonic.jpg" alt="glass bottle of lovett sundries brand aftershave tonic">
      <p>
        Most grocery store aftershave options come in a plastic bottle with a laundry list of ingredients. 
        Instead, look for something in an infinitely recyclable glass bottle with ingredients you've heard of.
        <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/products/aftershave-tonic?variant=39295560712289" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a> offers a six ingredient, glass bottle aftershave tonic for $20. Or you can use something 
        you already have at home like witch hazel or aloe vera.

      <h2 class="highlight">Sugar Wax</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/17-razors/sugar-wax.png" alt="wax made from sugar being used to remove hair from a leg">
      <p>
        If you prefer waxing for your unwanted hair removal, try waste free sugaring. 
        All you need is white sugar, lemon juice, and water to make the "wax", which spreads on your 
        problem areas and peels off without any plastic waste. For complete instructions, check out 
        this tutorial from <a href="https://gippslandunwrapped.com/2016/04/25/sugaring-the-waste-free-alternative-to-waxing/" target="__blank">
