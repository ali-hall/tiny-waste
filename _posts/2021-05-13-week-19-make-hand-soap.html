    Castile soap is non-toxic, organic, vegetable based jack of all trades. It can be used to clean 
    your body, your house, and even your pets! Castile soap comes unscented or in a variety of all natural scents and
    you can purchase a half gallon jug from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/bulk-castile-soap-saponified" target="__blank">Package Free Shop</a> for $60. Yes, this bulk castile soap comes in a 
    recyclable plastic bottle, but it is still a natural, low-waste alternative to many little hand-soap bottles.

  <h2>What you'll need:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Liquid Castile Soap - I like Dr</li>
    <li>Water </li>
    <li>(Optional) Essential Oil. If you are using scented castile soap, this is especially unnecessary.</li>
    <li>Small bottle with pump. I used an empty bottle that I already had. </li>
    <li>Funnel for pouring</li>
  </ul>
