  <p>In 2015, Americans placed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/07/are-alternate-utensils-for-take-out-an-envrioment-friendly-option/" 
    target="__blank">2 billion</a> delivery orders. Imagine if only half of those orders included a set of 
    disposable cutlery, how much unecessary waste is produced every year. I can't even imagine how that number skyrocketed since the global 
    pandemic began.

  <h4>What's the problem with disposable cutlery?</h4>
  <p>Most disposable utensils are made of plastic, which can take hundreds of years to break down.

  <h4>Are wooden chopsticks ok?</h4>
  <p>While wooden chopsticks are biodegradable, they aren't as innocent as they seem.  Globally, <a href="http://www.ecopedia.com/environment/how-wooden-chopsticks-are-killing-nature/"
    target="__blank">80 billion pairs</a> of disposable chopsticks are used and thrown away every year. 
    In China and Japan, manufacturers harvest over 20 million trees to keep up with that demand. 
    So, while chopsticks aren't the biggest threat to the environmet, we should definitely avoid deforestation 
    for the purpose of single-use disposables.
