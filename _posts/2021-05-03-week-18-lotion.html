  <h2>Why is lotion a problem?</h2>
  <p>
    It should come as no surprise that the majority of lotions come in plastic bottles. In 2018, in the U.S. alone, almost 
    7.9 billion units of rigid plastic were created just for beauty and personal care products, 
    according to Euromonitor International.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plastics are problematic because they are made 
    from non-renewable resources, have limited recyclability, and take hundreds if not thousands of 
    years to break down. Razors, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which 
    is problematic for two reasons: manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic break down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air.

  <h2>Are lotion ingredients harmful?</h2>
  <p>
    Lotions and moisturizers have been around since <a href="https://www.reference.com/history/lotion-first-invented-39582c63c6d76cb1" target="__blank">
    3,000 B.C.E.</a> Originially, they were made from natural ingredients like red ochre and animal 
    fats, but they've gotten significantly more science-based since then. While my primary goal is to 
    reduce waste, I do want to quickly touch on the ingredients found in lotion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lotion can be either a drug or a cosmetic, depending on its use. For example, when used as 
    treatment a disease, it's considered a drug. While if it's purpose is to simply moisturize, it will be 
    a cosmetic. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), "The law does not require cosmetic products 
    and ingredients, other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the market." 
    This means that many lotions have an array of questionable chemicals like parabens, which have been linked to 
    <a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/a20507577/harmful-ingredients-in-body-lotion/" target="__blank">
    hormone disruption and breast cancer</a>. In addition, cosmetics will often hide some of their ingredients 
    as "trade screts".

  <h2>What can I use instead?</h2>
