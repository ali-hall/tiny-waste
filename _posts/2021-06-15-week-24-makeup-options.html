    This week I took a good look at my beauty routine and its <a href="environmental-impact-of-makeup" target="__blank">
    environmental impact</a>. After taking a look at my makeup drawer, I realized just how much plastic
    waste I've produced over the last twenty years. As I use up the last of my convential makeup, it's 
    time to find a low-waste, eco-friendly replacement. Here are ten sustainable brands I've found 
    that cut back on plastic packaging and use natural ingredients.

    Now that you've decided what to put on your face, why not make the way you take it off a little
    better for the environment. Instead of toxic makeup remover, use something more natural like 
    <a href="diy-skin-care-routine.html" target="__blank">olive oil</a>. And instead of 
    disposable cotton rounds, <a href="make-reusable-cotton-rounds.html" target="__blank">make resuable ones</a>
    with cotton fabric scraps.
