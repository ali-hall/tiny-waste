  <h2>What's the problem with face wash?</h2>

  <p>
    If you've been reading my posts consistently, you've probably started to notice some repetition.
    The problems with face wash are very similar to those with body wash and hand soap. I mention this so 
    you can feel free to spend your time In short, they come in plastic bottles and contain environmentally harmful ingredients. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Like most of the previous weeks, one major concern is that face wash comes in plastic bottles. 
    Plastics are problematic because they are made from non-renewable resources, have limited 
    recyclability, and take hundreds if not thousands of years to break down. 
    Hand soap and sanitizer bottles, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which is harmful for two reasons: 
    manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic breaks down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air.

  <h2>So other than the plastic bottle, face wash is fine for the environment?</h2>
  <p>
    Not exactly. While a few ingredients like microbeads and triclosan have been banned by 
    the FDA, there are still a few that, when washed down the drain can be <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/beauty-product-toxic-ingredients-environmental-impact" target="__blank">
    harmful to marine life</a>. Parabens, used as preservatives, are endocrine disruptors that effect the 
    hormone levels of marine organisms and potentially, humans. While saponins, used as cleansing agents, are 
    toxic to an array of aquatic life.

  <h2>Are face wash bottles recyclable?</h2>
  <p>
    Some are and some aren't. You'll have to check the individual bottle. Note that the recycling symbol
    does not automatically mean an item is recycling. That symbol and the number inside of it merely classifies 
    the type of plastic it is made of. Check to see exactly which materials your curbside recyclying accepts 
    before tossing anything in those bins to avoid <a href="wishful-recycling.html" target="__blank">wishful recycling</a>.

    If face wash bottles cannot be recycled in your town, you can print out a free shipping label and 
    send them to <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/garnier#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">

  <h2>How can my face wash routine be more sustainable?</h2>
  <p>
    Face soap that comes in the form of a bar is typically the best option since it requires little 
    to know packaging. Other options include face wash that comes in infinitely recyclable glass bottle 
    or refillable aluminum bottles. Read my next post for a list of <a href="10-sustainable-face-wash-options.html" target="__blank">
