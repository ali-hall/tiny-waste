      <h2>Safety Razor</h2>

      <p>
        You probably haven't seen a safety razor since your grandfather's day, but thanks to their 
        sustainable ?? they are making a huge comeback. While there are many safety razors on the 
        market, <a href="https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-razor" target="__blank">The Leaf Razor</a> 
        is easily the most popular thanks to it's pivoting head and multi-blade system. At $85, it is 
        among some of the pricier options. However, it has a lifetime guarantee, so you should never 
        have to replace it. If you do have to dispose of your Leaf Razor for any reason, both the body 
        and the blades are 100% recyclable with metals, although you may have to find a spot that accepts scrap metal. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite ready to spend big on a safety razor? <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/albatross-flagship-3-piece-razor" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a> offers a more traditional model for $25. While this is still more expensive than 
        a disposable razor, remember that you'll save a significant amount of cash and plastic waste in the long run. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Whichever safety razor you end up with, you can collect the used blades and send them to <a href="https://albatrossdesigns.it/pages/albatross-blade-take-back-program" target="__blank">
        The Albatross Blade Take Back Program</a>. For details on how to participate, head to their website.

      <p>
        The one drawback to safety razors is that they aren't allowed on planes. Normally I recommend using 
        what you have and only replacing it when necessary. However, in this case, it's best to save your 
        disposable razors for travel.

      <h2 class="highlight">Shaving Soap</h2>

      <p>
        Shaving cream containers may be recyclable, but because theey are aerosols, they release chemicals that 
        contribute to global warming into the atmosphere. A more sustainable option is a soap bar 
        like this one from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/amber-ale-shave-body-bar" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a>.

        You obviously don't have to use a shaving brush, but that's your method of choice, opt 
        I like this one frome <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/758286500/natural-shaving-brush-zero-waste-100?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=compostable+shave+brush&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1">

      <p>
        If waxing is more your speed, try a waste free sugaring. All you need is white sugar, 
        lemon juice, and water to make the "wax", which spreads on your problem areas and peels off 
        without any plastic waste. For complete instructions, check out this tutorial on <a href="https://gippslandunwrapped.com/2016/04/25/sugaring-the-waste-free-alternative-to-waxing/" target="__blank">
