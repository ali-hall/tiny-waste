  <p> 
    This week, I made the switch to plastic-free toothpaste, but I still had a few plastic 
    toothpaste tubes to discard of. Toothpaste tubes are made to last for hundreds of years, but are typically only used for a few months. 
    Their mixed materials are recyclable or biodegradable, so billions end up in our landfills every year.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started scrolling through Pinterest for ways to upcycle my toothpaste tubes, when I came across
    a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Travel-Safe/" targete="__blank">brilliant idea</a> to use 
    it as a travel safe! Large toothpaste tubes are perfect for hiding cash and credit cards in plain site. 
    So, using this idea, with a few improvements, I made my own toothpaste tube wallet.
