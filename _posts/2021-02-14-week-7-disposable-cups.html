  <p>I hope y'all are ready to kick your Tiny Waste resolution up a notch, because this week, we are giving up 
    disposable cups. Take minute to go through a typical week and think about how many times you encounter 
    the throw-away cup...cafes, restaurants, take out, fast food, gatherings...the little beasts are everywhere.
    Don't worry, we don't have say goodbye to Starbucks, we are just enjoying those thematic lattes without 
    producing quite as much waste.

  <h2 class="highlight">The Problem With Disposable Cups</h2>
  <p>I can't be the only one that notices all of the public trash cans overflowing with disposable cups. 
    And you know what? The trash can is exactly where they belong, since most aren't recyclable or compostable!
    Disposable cups are garbage that will go to a landfill and stay there for hundreds of years. 
  </p>
  <p>More than <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/disposable-cups-market" 
    target="__blank">500 billion</a> disposable cups are used across the world every year. The three main types 
    of single-use cups are paper, plastic, and styrofoam. All three are pure garbage.
  </P>

  <p>One argument that you might see as <em>for</em> disposable cups is that they save water because you don't have 
    wash them. However, that ignores the amount of water used to <em>make</em> them. According to an article from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/key-questions-finite-planet"
    target="__blank">The Guardian</a>, a typical paper coffe cup requires 2.5 litres to make the plastic lid, 
    as well as 5.6 litres for the paper cup and sleeve.
  </p>
    
    
  <p>It's estimated that Americans alone throw away <a href="https://blog.epa.gov/tag/disposable-coffee-cup/" target="__blank"></a>
    <strong>25 billion</strong></a> coffee cups every year. If we take a look at the resourcees it takes 
    just to make the little devils, that means: 
    <ul>
      <li>9.4 million trees harvested just for cups</li>
      <li>363 million pounds of waste were generated</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="highlight">PAPER</h2>
  <p>Paper - 16 billion trash</p>

  <h2 class="highlight">FOAM</h2>
  <p>Foam, or polystyrene, is just another form of plastic. <a href="https://sciencing.com/long-styrofoam-break-down-5407877.html" target="__blank">
    Sciencing.com</a> estimates that styrofoam makes up 30% of US Landfills. According to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/02/your-paper-cup-is-destroying-the-world.html#:~:text=One%20estimate%20says%20that%20making,will%20eventually%20go%20to%20war." 
    target="__blank">NYMag.com</a> styrene foam requires 12% of the water paper does for production. However, Americans alone toss <a href="https://www.earthday.org/fact-sheet-how-much-disposable-plastic-we-use/" target="__blank">
    25 billion styrofoam cups</a> Trash</p>

  <h2 class="highlight">PLASTIC</h2>
  <p>It takes <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/how-many-gallons-of-water-does-it-take-to-make-4858491" 
    target="__blank">1.85 gallons</a> of water to manufacture the plastic for the bottle in the average commercial 
    bottle of water.</a>

  <h2 class="highligh">COVID-19</h2>
  <p>Now, let me address the current pandemic and it's effect on disposable cups. The numbers in this post are all 
    based on research from 2018, but based on observation alone, I imagine they've skyrocketed 
    in the last year. As you probably know, big chains like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts put their reusable cup 
    discount programs on hold to prevent the spread of Covid-19. 
    While this could be used as an excuse to put this week's resolution on hold, I encourage you to
