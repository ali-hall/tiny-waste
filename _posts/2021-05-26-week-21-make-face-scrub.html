  <p>
    Our skin care routine can be complex and expensive. Before trying to shrink my waste, I was spending hundreds 
    of dollars every few months on teeny tiny bottles of cleanser, scrub, and moisturizer. Now, 
    I look to other bloggers for natural recipes that I can make with ingredient I already have at home. 
    I'm ruducing both my waste and my spending by making all of my skin care products instead of buying them.

    <a href="https://islandbeauty.co/blog/face-care/diy-homemade-coffee-face-scrub/" target="__blank">Island Beauty</a> 
    has loads of natural self care recipes, but I love this coffee scrub because it uses coffee grounds, 
    which would normally end up in the garbage! This recipe calls for coconut oil, but I've used olive oil 
    instead and had the same results.

    A few weeks ago, I shared <a href="moisturizers-found-in-the-kitchen.html" target="__blank">
    5 Kitchen Ingredients that Make Excellent Moisturizers</a>. While olive oil does the trick for me, 
    you may be looking for a more traditional recipe, like this one from <a href="https://www.ouroilyhouse.com/natural-face-moisturizer-recipe/" target="__blank">

    I started using olive oil as a makeup remover when I realized we always have some on hand. 
    <a href="https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/natural-makeup-remover/" target="__blank">Don't Waste the Crumbs</a>
    gives six other single ingredient options that will remove even the toughest mascara, no problem.
