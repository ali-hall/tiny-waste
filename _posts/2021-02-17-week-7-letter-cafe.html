<section class="post__letter">
  <p>Good afternoon,</p>

  <p>I hope you and your staff have been doing well during this crazy year. Jumpin' Java is my go-to coffee 
    spot. I love the atmosphere and the employees are always super friendly. 
  </p>

  <p>This year I'm resolving to "shrink my waste", so I've been extra aware of the plastic I come in contact
    with on a daily basis. I recently found out that plastic takes hundreds of years to break down and only 9% 
    gets recycled. I also learned that paper coffee cups are actually lined with plastic, so they aren't recyclable 
    or biodegradable. Since Americans throw away 500 billion disposable cups every day, this has become a major 
    problem for the environment. 
  </p>

  <p>I'm wondering if you would consider offering a 10&#162; discount to customers that bring a reusable cup.  
    This would encourage and reward people for making a sustainable choice. Big chains like Starbucks and 
    Dunkin' Donuts have similar programs...although I recognize that they are, understandably, on hold for the pandemic. 
  </p>

  <p>Another way to reduce plastic waste would be to offer plastic lids instead of automatically giving them with each cup.
    I've reached out to a handful of cafe owners who already implement this policy and they confirmed that about 
    a third of people refuse the lid, even if it is offered to them.
  </p>

  <p>Both of these small changes would cut down on a significant amount of plastic waste and ultimately, 
    cut down on your expenses. I hope you'll consider this request from a loyal customer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you,
  </p>

  <p>
    Alexandra
