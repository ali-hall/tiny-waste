    Sometimes take out is a necessity, and while some containers are recyclable, not all are. 
    For instance salads often come in #6 plastics, but those aren't always accepted in curbside recycling.
    Instead of sending thosee #6 plastics to a landfill, you can make cute, on-of-a-kind jewelry!

  <h4>What You'll Need:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      #6 Plastics - only clear #6 will work, like clamshells

    </li>
    <li>
      Scrap paper for making stencil

      <p>
        1. Grab a clear #6 plastic container. I see them used most for salads and berries.
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/10-take-out-containers/2-cut-flats.jpg" alt="scissors cutting into plastic clamshell">
      <p>
        2. Cut out the flat areas of your clamshell. I had one from the top and one from the bottom.

      <p>
        3. Use a scrap piece of paper to draw a stencil that is the appropriate size for your 
        plastic pieces.

      <img src="assets/posts/10-take-out-containers/5-color.jpg" alt="two sharpies and two plastic pieces with green jungle leaves drawn on them">
      <p>
        5. Use sharpies to color in your image. You can also use pencil colors, but you'll have to sand the plastic first.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/10-take-out-containers/6-cut-leaves.jpg" alt="pair of scissors and plastic cut out in the shape of jungle leaves">
      <p>
        6. Cut out the design you wish to shrink.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/10-take-out-containers/7-punch-hole.jpg" alt="close up of plastic leaf with hole punched in the top">
      <p>
        7. Use a hole punch (or scissors) to put a hole in the plastic, wherever you would like add the jewelry findings. 
        Make sure to put it no more that a quartere of an inch from the edge.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/10-take-out-containers/8-foil.jpg" alt="two plastic jungle leaves on a piece of plastic">
      <p>
        8. Preheat your oven to 325&#176;. Put your plastic on a piece of scrap foil, marker side up, and bake for 3 minutes.
        Let cool before handling.
      </p>

        necklaces... anything you want!
