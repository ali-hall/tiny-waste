  Only half of Americans have access to curbside recycling and even then, there are still plenty
  of recyclable goods being sent to landfills.

  <h2>Target</h2>
  <a href="https://help.target.com/help/TargetGuestHelpArticleDetail?articleId=ka91Y000000g4OpQAI&articleTitle=Can+I+recycle+items+at+a+Target+store%3F">Target</a>
  <p>Target stores have a guest recycling station located in the front of each store. 
    The station is available for bottle and can recycling (aluminum, glass and plastic 
    beverage containers), plastic film (high and low density such as plastic bags and 
    bubble wrap), and small device electronics recycling (think MP3 players, GPS devices 
    and ink cartridges).
