    We've established that <a href="disposable-utensils.html" target="__blank">disposable utensils</a> are a problem, now let's take a look at a few
    options you have for reusable cutlery.
  </p>

  <ol class="pic-text">
    <h2 class="highlight">USE WHAT YOU HAVE</h4>
    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/home-utensils.jpg" alt="utensils divider full of silverwear">
      <p>
        The cheapest and most environmentally friendly option is always to use what you have. Why not 
        borrow a few of your utensils for the day and throw them in the dishwasher when you come home at night.
      </p>
    </li>

    <h2 class="highlight">BUY SECONDHAND</h2>
    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/second-hand-cutlery.jpg" alt="pile of unmatched silverwear">
      <p>
        You could also buy second hand at a thrift store or garage sale. I've gotten an entire bag of silverwear 
        from Goodwill for $5.00. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <h2 class="highlight">SPORKS</h2>
    <li>

        <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/spork.jpg" alt="metal spork">
      </a>
      <p>
        Sporks are a great option as they are compact and do the work of two utensils. You can find 
        sporks at any store that carries camping supplies.
      </p>
    </li>

    <h2 class="highlight">BAMBOO</h2>
    <li>
      <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/to-go-ware" target="__blank">
        <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/package-free-cutlery.jpg" alt="bamboo utensils with black case">
      </a>
      <p>Bamboo utensils are completely biodegradable! The set in the picture is from 
        <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/to-go-ware" target="__blank">Package Free</a>
        , but I've seen a lot of cute options at <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=bamboo%20cutlery" target="__blank">
        Etsy</a>. One big bonus to bamboo is that the knives can be taken on planes. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <h2 class="highlight">OUTLERY</h2>
    <li>
      <a href="https://outlery.com/">
        <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/outlery.jpg" target="__blank">
      </a>
      <p>Outlery is a popular option for travel utensils because at 3.2" x 2.5" x 0.8", it is 
        extremely compact. Outlery utensils are stainless steel and their products are completely plastic free.</p>
