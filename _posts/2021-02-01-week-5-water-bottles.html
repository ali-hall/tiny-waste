  <p>Boy oh boy, plastic water bottles. Where do I begin? </p>
  
  <p>First of all, the US alone consumes <a href="https://www.aiga.org/case-study-watershed#:~:text=Watershed%20is%20an%20eco%2Dart,informational%20signs%20regarding%20this%20consumption." target="__blank">
    1,500</a> plastic water bottles every second and <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">38 billion</a>
    end up in a landfill <em>every year</em>. Globally, humans buy 
    <a href="https://www.earthday.org/fact-sheet-single-use-plastics/" target="__blank">
    1,000,000</a> plastic bottles per minute.</p>

  <p>Now, let's talk economics. Bottled water costs <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">
    1,000 times</a> more than tap water. In fact, 90% of the cost is for the bottle. In other words, when we purchase bottled water, we are 
    basically just paying for a plastic bottle.
  </p>

  <p>But the reason we're all here is for the environmental impact and trust me when I tell 
    you, it's not pretty.</p>
