      <img src="assets/posts/straws/1-bamboo.jpg" alt="green bamboo stick">
      <p>1. Grab a stick of bamboo. I found this one in my back yard.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/2-saw-first.jpg" alt="hand saw cutting bamboo">
      <p>2. Using a hand saw or strong clippers, cut the bamboo on either side 
        of the knot.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/3-saw-other-side.jpg" alt="hand saw cutting bamboo">
      <p>3. Now, cut the bamboo again at your desired length, but before the next knot. 
        The piece you're using to make a straw should not have any knots.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/4-three-straws.jpg" alt="hand hold three cut bamboo pieces">
      <p>4. Cut as many as you like so you can make a few straws at one time.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/5-sand.jpg" alt="hand sanding cut bamboo piece">
      <p>5. With course sand paper or a sanding block, sand the pieces until there is no more 
        peeling back. I took as much of the dark green off as I could.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/6-sand-edges.jpg" alt="hand sanding the edges of the bamboo pieces">
      <p>6. Sand the edges until nice and smooth. I found it easiest to put the sand paper 
        on the table and then rub the edges on it. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/7-sand-until-smooth.jpg" alt="clost of of sanded bamboo piece that shows hollow center">
      <p>7. Once it is completely smooth, you'll clear out the center. You'll notice 
        that bamboo is naturally hollow, but you want to get any extra bits out. Mine had a 
        sort of paper inside that I was able to pull out easily.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/8-clean-inside.jpg" alt="hand using a straw cleaner to clean out the inside of bamboo piece">
      <p>8. Use a straw cleaner or pipe cleaner to really clean out the inside of your bamboo.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="asests/posts/straws/9-boiling-water.jpg" alt="bamboo pieces in a pot of boiling water">
      <p>9. To detoxify your bamboo, soak it in a pot of boiling salt water for at least 10 minutes. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/10-rinse.jpg" alt="hand holding three bamboo pieces under running water">
      <p>10. Rinse the bamboo and give the inside another cleaning.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/straws/11-let-dry.jpg"  alt="three wet bamboo pieces on a towel">
      <p>11. Leave your straws to dry. Once dry, they are ready to use!</p>
