    Take out is such an incredible invention that benefits everyone. Busy parents, people in quarantine, 
    women who loathe cooking (that last one is me). I think it's unrealistic to ask everyone to completely cut it out of there lives. It is, however, 
    important to understand the effect take out containers have on the environment and make a concious 
    effort to cut down on the amount we send to a landfill.

  <h4>Are they recyclable?</h4>
  <p>
    Some, but not all, take out containers are recyclable. One big misconception is that an item is 
    recyclable if it has a recycling symbol on it. However, The small number you see inside
    the recycling symbol on plastics only classifies the type of plastic. It does not necessarily indicate recyclability. 
    You'll have to see which numbers are accepted by your curbside recycling, usually #1-2 are ok. In addition, make sure 
    to empty and rinse your containers so they don't contaminate 
  </p>

  <p>
    Styrofoam containers are rarely accepted in curbside recycling. Paper soup cups go straight to the landfill,
    since they are lined with plastic and the mixed materials are problematic for recycling facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clean paper products like cardboard drink containers are both recyclable and compostable. Pizza boxes 
    are only recyclable if they aren't covered in grease, but they can be composted.

  <h4>What if they are compostable?</h4>
  <p>
    There are lot of disposable products out there that claim to be compostable, but if you 
    look a little closer, you'll notice wording along the lines of "Compostable in industrial facilities."
    This means they won't break down in your backyard compost or, for that matter, in a landfill. 
    These products should be avoided unless you have access to a commercial composting facility.
