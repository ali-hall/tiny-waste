  <h2 class="highlight">The Problem with Single Use Plastic Water Bottles</h2>
  <p>Boy oh boy, plastic water bottles. Where do I begin? </p>
  
  <p>The US alone consumes <a href="https://www.aiga.org/case-study-watershed#:~:text=Watershed%20is%20an%20eco%2Dart,informational%20signs%20regarding%20this%20consumption." target="__blank">
    1,500</a> plastic water bottles every second and <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">38 billion</a>
    end up in a landfill <em>every year</em>. Globally, humans buy 
    <a href="https://www.earthday.org/fact-sheet-single-use-plastics/" target="__blank">
    1,000,000</a> plastic bottles per minute.</p>

  <p>Now, let's talk economics. Bottled water costs <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">
    1,000 times</a> more than tap water. In fact, 90% of the cost is for the bottle. In other words, when we purchase bottled water, we are 
    basically just paying for a plastic bottle. Families could save <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/save-money-with-water-filter.htm#:~:text=And%20when%20you%20consider%20that,four%20down%20to%20just%20%241.10." target="__blank">
    hundreds of dollars</a> every year by drinking filtered tap water instead.
  </p>

  <p>But the reason we're all here is for the environmental impact and trust me when I tell 
    you, it's not pretty. You may start to notice a little repition here, but plastic never decomposes. 
    It only breaks down into little bitty baby micro and nanoplastics that have infiltrated nearly 
    every aspect of life on earth. Plastic particles have been found at the bottom of the sea, in our soil, 
    and in the air we breath . According to <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/microplastics-are-literally-raining-our-national-parks-and-wilderness-areas#:~:text=on%20mobile%20device-,Microplastics%20Are%20Literally%20Raining%20on%20Our%20National%20Parks%20and%20Wilderness,protected%20areas%20in%20the%20West." target="__blank">
    one study</a>, "up to 300 million plastic bottles' worth of of plastic particles per year landed 
    on 11 remote protected areas in the West." Like I said...<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/you-eat-thousands-of-bits-of-plastic-every-year/" target="__blank">
    everywhere.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    On a more personal level, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/most-plastic-products-contain-potentially-toxic-chemicals/" target="__blank">
    studies</a> have shown that plastic leeches toxins into the water, which has been linked to various health
    problems including <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-and-human-health-a-lifecycle-approach-to-plastic-pollution/#:~:text=99%25%20of%20plastic%20comes%20from%20fossil%20fuels.&text=Over%20170%20fracking%20chemicals%20that,the%20immune%20system%2C%20and%20more." target="__blank">
    cancer and reproductive issues</a>. As someone who is currently trying to start a family, I found this 
    more than a little horrifying.

  <h2 class="highlight">What Can I Use Instead?</h2>
  <p>Use what you have! There are thousands of reusable water bottles out there and I imagine most of us already 
    own one that we only use to occupy that top shelf in the pantry. If you don't have one, 
    consider upcycling a glass jar or screw top bottle. You <em>do not</em> need to spend any money 
    to make a difference. Of course, if you are set on buying a bottle to jumpstart this 
    new habit, make it <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/glass-water-bottles" target="__blank">
    glass</a> or <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/best-stainless-steel-water-bottles-4584294" target="__blank">
    stainless steel</a>.
