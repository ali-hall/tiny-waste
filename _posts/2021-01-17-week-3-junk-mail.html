<section>
  <p>Last Monday, when I took out the recycling, I noticed that my paper bin was almost entirely made up of
    junk mail. Coupons, catalogues and credit card offers that I never asked for and I never open. I have a 
    pretty good feeling I'm not the only one with a surplus of unwanted mail, since the 
    <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" target="__blank">USPS</a> reported delivering
    75.7 billion units of marketing mail in 2019, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/
    how-to-stop-junk-mail-and-save-trees--and-your-sanity/2018/02/12/6000e4c4-05d9-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html" 
    target="__blank">44% went unopened.</a> 
  </p>

  <p>Ready for the worst part? It's estimated that it takes about <a href="https://healtheplanet.com/100-ways-to-heal-the-planet/junk-mail/" target="__blank">
    100 million trees</a> to generate a year's worth of that unwanted mail. This is especially problematic since 
    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deforestation-and-global-warming/" target="__blank">deforestation</a> 
    accounts for 15% of global carbon emissions.
  </p>

  <p>At this point, I'm sure you're itching to get your name off those mailing lists, so let's get started.

  <h2 class="main">Phone Books</h2>
  <p>I can't remember the last time I used a phone book, so it was easy for me to say goodbye.
    A quick visit to <a href="https://www.yellowpagesoptout.com/user/register?zipcode=19085" target="__blank">Yellow pages</a>
    had me off the list in less than a minute.

  <h2 class="highlight">Bills</h2>
  <p>Ok, I know bills aren't exactly "junk", but they are definitely a waste of paper. If you haven't 
    already made the switch to paperless billing, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. These days, most of your
    major bills include instructions on how to opt-out of printed copies. And don't worry, if the need arises,
    you can always print a copy from your account online.
