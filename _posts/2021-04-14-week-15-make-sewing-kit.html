    Old floss containers are made of mixed materials that are difficult to recycle. Instead of 
    tossing yours into the garbage, upcycle it into a cute travel sewing kit! The spool inside is 
    perfect for adding thread and the sharp metal piece doubles as a convenient thread cutter, so you 
    won't need scissors when you're out and about.

      <p>
        1. Get an old floss container. You can make a sewing kit from just about any shape.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/2-remove-label.jpg" alt="floss container with label removed">
      <p>
        2. Remove the label. They come off easily, I didn't need any special tools.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/3-remove-piece.jpg" alt="floss container with inside piece taken out">
      <p>
        3. Remove the inner plastic piece. It should pop right out.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/4-wrap-thread.jpg" alt="black thread wrapped around small plastic piece from inside floss container">
      <p>
        4. Wrap your thread around the small round wheel where the floss usually goes. Choose a color that will be most usefill in your sewing kit and use as much as you like.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/5-thread-bobbin.jpg" alt="plastic wheel with thread put back on bigger plastic piece">
      <p>
        5. Put your threaded wheel back on the bigger plastic piece and thread it as the floss would have been.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/6-insert-piece.jpg" alt="plastic piece put back into floss container">
      <p>
        6. Put the now threaded plastic piece back into your floss container.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/7-cut-sponge.jpg" alt="small strip of kitchen sponge being cut">
      <p>
        7. Cut a small strip of your sponge. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/8-add-sponge.jpg" alt="Sponge placed in lid of floss container">
      <p>
        8. Fit the sponge inside the lid, trimming away excess so it fits in the lid of your floss container.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/15-oral-care/9-add-notions.jpg" alt="needle and button added to sponge">
      <p>
        9. Add a needle, button, and whatever other sewing notions you would like, to the sponge. You can 
        cut small holes so that the piece will fit nice and snug.
      </p>
    </li>
