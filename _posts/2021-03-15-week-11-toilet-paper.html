    I think we can all agree that toilet paper is one of life's necessities. I can only think of 
    a handful of days in my life that I didn't use toilet paper, and they are all while I was hiking 
    the Appalachian Trail and ran out. I have used a lot of toilet paper in my life and I'm confident 
    that anyone else reading this has too.

    The average American uses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/world/americas/26iht-paper.1.20453524.html" target="__blank">
    23.6 rolls</a> of toilet every year. Countrywide, we're at about <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-bidets/" target="__blank">
    36.5 billion</a> rolls annually.

  <h4>What's the problem with toilet paper?</h4>
  <p>
    As you probably already know, toilet paper comes from trees... a lot of trees. Worldwide, an estimated <a href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2010/04/16/toilet-paper-wipes-out-27000-trees-a-day/" target="__blank">
    27,000 trees</a> are cut down <em>every day</em>, just for toilet paper.

    I want to briefly go over the negative effects of deforestation as mentioned in an article by <a href="https://sciencing.com/four-consequences-deforestation-7622.html" target="__blank">

        Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are the leading cause of climate change.

      <li>
        Soil Erosion - Roots from trees and other plants keep soil compact. When forests are removed, 
        the soil loses it's anchor, making way for erosion and in serious cases, disastrous mudslides.

      <li>
        Water Cycle Disruption - Trees soak up water from the ground which they release into the atmosphere 
        during photosynthesis. That moisture eventually becomes rain, which goes back into the groud and our oceans.
        When large swaths of trees are removed, the land can become barren and dry.

    Popular brands like Charmin, Cottonelle, and Quilted Northern all use virgin pulp for their products, 
    meaning it contains no recycled material. The production of this virgin pulp emits <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257680097_A_comparison_of_the_GHG_emissions_caused_by_manufacturing_tissue_paper_from_virgin_pulp_or_recycled_waste_paper" target="__blank">
    30% more greenhouse emissions</a> than recycled material.

    473,587,500,000 gallons of water to produce the paper and 253,000 tons of chlorine for bleaching.
