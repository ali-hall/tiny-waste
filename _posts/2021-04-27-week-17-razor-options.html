      <h2>Safety Razor</h2>

        You probably haven't seen a safety razor since your grandfather's day, but thanks to their 
        sustainable ?? they are making a huge comeback. While there are many safety razors on the 
        market, <a href="https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-razor" target="__blank">The Leaf Razor</a> 
        is easily the most popular thanks to it's pivoting head and multi-blade system. At $85, it is 
        among some of the pricier options. However, it has a lifetime guarantee, so you should never 
        have to replace it. If you do have to dispose of your Leaf Razor for any reason, both the body and the blades are 100% recyclable in metal recycling.

        Not quite ready to spend big on a safety razor? <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/albatross-flagship-3-piece-razor" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a> offers a more traditional model for $25. While this is still more expensive than 
        a disposable razor, remember that you'll save a significant amount of cash and plastic waste in the long run.

      <p>
        The one drawback to safety razors is that they aren't allowed on planes. Normally I recommend using 
        what you have and only replacing it when necessary. However, in this case, it's best to save your 
        disposable razors for travel.

      <p>
        Shaving cream containers may be recyclable, but because theey are aerosols, they release chemicals that 
        contribute to global warming into the atmosphere. A more sustainable option is a soap bar 
        like this one from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/amber-ale-shave-body-bar" target="__blank">
        Package Free Shop</a>.
