    1. Americans make up roughly 5% of the world’s population, but generate nearly 40% of the world’s 
    total waste.

    2. The average American produces roughly 5 pounds of garbage per day. In 2018, the US alone produced 
    292.4 million tons of waste. EPA

    3. 50% of waste in the US ends up in landfills. “Landfills are not designed to break down waste, only to store it, 
    according to the NSWMA. But garbage in a landfill does decompose, albeit slowly and in a sealed, oxygen-free 
    environment. Because of the lack of oxygen, bacteria in the waste produce methane gas, which is highly 
    flammable and dangerous if allowed to collect underground. It is also a potent greenhouse gas and contributes 
    global warming.” ~<a href="https://www.livescience.com/32786-what-happens-inside-a-landfill.html">Live Science</a>

    4. Each year, Americans discard nearly 40 million tons of food, which is the single largest component taking up space 
    inside US landfills.

  <p>
    5.  U.S. recycling levels are currently at 21.4%. When those levels reach 75%, it will equal taking 
    approximately 55 million cars off the road for an entire year.

  <p>
    6. Only about 8% of plastic is actually recycled, while about 76 percent ends up in landfills.

  </p>

  <p>
    7. Some plastics, like grocery bags, can take up to 1000 years to decompose.
  </p>

  <p>
    8. Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations. 
    That’s the equivalent of setting five garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the world.

  </p>

  <p>
    9. Thanks to the action of ocean currents, marine debris often collects within ocean gyres, forming what’s 
    known as a garbage “patch.” In the largest gyres, these “patches” can span a million square miles. 
    The majority of the material is plastic.

  </p>

  <p>
    10. Almost half of all seabird species, 22% of cetaceans, all sea turtle species, and a growing 
    list of fish species have been documented with plastic found in or around their bodies.
  </p>

  <p>
    11. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional 
    deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.

  <p>
  Obviously, there is A LOT of science behind climate change and global warming that this page doesn’t 
  cover and while these facts were scary enough to make me start paying attention to my garbage output, 
  others may need a little more convincing. There are a number of science based books and podcasts that 
  delve deeper into every aspect of the harmful impact humans have had on planet Earth. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> even has an 
  entire website dedicated to the science behind global warming including cause and effect. I implore you 
  to do your own research and find out how devastating the climate crisis really is.
