  <p>
    There are plenty of <a href="deodorant-options.html" target="__blank">sustainable deodorant options</a> 
    available to us, but if you're on a budget, the prices might feel a little out of reach. Fortunately, 
    deodorant is very easy to make at home with a few simple ingredients. You can put your deodorant into 
    a empty deodorant tube or keep it in a jar and apply with your fingers or a popsicle stick. 
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Please note that 
    if this is your first time using natural deodorant, it may take a few weeks for your body to adjust. 
    Until then, you might want to apply it multiple times throughout the day to keep your underarms smelling fresh.

        7. Cut a small oval of wax paper to fit the inside of your empty deodorant tube. This will keep
