<p>Now that I've gotten a handle on what can go into my curbside recycling bins, it's time to find a way to 
  recycle everything else.
 Here are a few things that come up fairly frequently in my house: 

Electronic waste: Only 10% of global e-waste gets recycled, while the rest of it ends up getting 
landfilled or incinerated. E-waste is made of all sorts of harmful chemicals, so if it is mishandled during 
disposal, these chemicals end up in our soil, water, and air. Best Buy takes loads of electronic waste.

Running Shoes: Old kicks can be donated to an organization like Soles4Souls, which gives gently used shoes 
to people in poverty. Or, they can be dropped off at any Nike location, where they will be recycling into 
new material.  https://www.nike.com/help/a/recycle-shoes

Batteries: Home Depot and Lowes both recycle batteries. In most locations, you can drop them off in store. 

Everything else: Just about anything you can think of can be recycled through Terracycle. 
https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/ Simply order a box, fill it up and send it back. 

From now on, before I absent-mindedly throw something into the garbage, Iâ€™ll do a quick google search to 
see if there are any recycling options.
