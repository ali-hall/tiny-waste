  <h2 class="hightlight">Tooth Tablets</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to zero waste toothpaste, tablets are hands down my favorite. There is no gel or 
      liquid, which means they are travel friendly and don't make the same mess as traditional toothpaste. 
      I also appreciate that you use one tablet per brush, so you know exactly how many brushes you can get.
      All you do is pop the tablet it in your mouth and chew until foamy, then you're ready to brush!

      If you've ever brushed your teeth with baking soda, you know how tooth powder works. All you do is wet your 
      toothbrush, stick it in the powder, and brush your teeth normally.
