    Light bulbs, appliances, hot showers, heating and cooling all require electricity to fulfill our most 
    basic needs. In fact, with the exception of my <a href="what-is-tiny-waste.html" target="__blank">Appalachian Trail thru hike</a>, 
    I can't recall a day spent without it. So, this week, I've chosen to focus on electricity, which generates the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="__blank">
    second largest share of greenhouse gas emissions</a>.

  <h2>Why is electricty such a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="__blank">Approximately 62% of electricty</a> 
    comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.

  <h2>Are there more sustainable energy options?</h2>
  <p>
    There are a number of renewable resources that are significantly better for the environment.
    
  </p>

  <p>
    Since most of these renewable resources aren't widely available to the public, it's important 
    to reach out to your local representative and request that our government make a plan to reduce 
    emissions by investing in renewable resources and elimating fossil based fuel sources. You can use 
    my <a href="" target="__blank">letter of the week</a> 
    as a template.

  <h2>How can I waste less electricity?</h2>
  <p>
    While switching to solar pannels may not be in the cards right away, there are plenty of little 
    ways you can cut back around the house. Turning the lights off when you leave a room and washing 
    laundry with cold water are both small changes that make a big difference. Read my next post for 
    <a href="15-ways-to-cut-down-electricity-usage.html" target="__blank">15 ways to use less electricity</a>
    and remember that cutting back is not only better for the environment, but it can seriously 
    reduce your monthly spending.
