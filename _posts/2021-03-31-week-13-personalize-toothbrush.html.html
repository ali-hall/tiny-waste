    Bamboo toothbrushes are much better for the environment than their plastic counterparts. However, they 
    often lack the distinguishing features, like color, that make them easy to tell apart. I share almost  
    everything with my husband, but I draw the line at swapping toothbrushes.

    My first thought was to paint them different colors, but adding paint would mean it can no longer go into my 
    compost bin. I also didn't want to risk adding any chemicals with a sharpie marker. Instead, I decided 
    to use a wood burning tool, that could make cute designs without sacrificing the integrity of the bamboo.
