  <p>Last Monday, when I took out the recycling, I noticed that my paper bin was almost entirely made up of
    junk mail. Coupons, catalogues and credit card offers that I never asked for and I never open. I have a 
    pretty good feeling I'm not the only one with a surplus of unwanted mail, since the 
    <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" target="__blank">USPS</a> reported delivering
    75.7 billion units of marketing mail in 2019, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/
    how-to-stop-junk-mail-and-save-trees--and-your-sanity/2018/02/12/6000e4c4-05d9-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html" 
    target="__blank">44% went unopened.</a> 
  </p>

  <p>Ready for the worst part? It's estimated that it takes about <a href="https://healtheplanet.com/100-ways-to-heal-the-planet/junk-mail/" target="__blank">
    100 million trees</a> to generate a year's worth of that unwanted mail. This is especially problematic since 
    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deforestation-and-global-warming/" target="__blank">deforestation</a> 
    accounts for 15% of global carbon emissions.
  </p>

  <p>At this point, I'm sure you're itching to get your name off those mailing lists, so let's get started.</p>
