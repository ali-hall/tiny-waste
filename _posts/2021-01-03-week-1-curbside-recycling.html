    I chose “Recycling” for the first week of my Tiny Waste Resolution because it takes a significant chunk out 
    of <!--more-->my landfill contribution, but it seems easy enough to implement without making me want to quit within the 
    first week. Most zero wasters claim that recycling should be a last resort and maybe by the end of the year 
    it will be, but in the mean time, I want to make sure I’m doing it right. So, let’s get started!

  <h2 class="accent">Find out my local options</h2> 
    <p>
      To get started, I searched the internet to see if my area offers a recycling 
      program. Fortunately, it does! A quick search for “Radnor Township recycling” brought me to the city’s trash 
      and refuse web page, where I found a pick up calendar, guidelines and list of acceptable contributions. 
      If your area does not offer a recycling program, why not <a href="#"></a>write a letter</a> requesting one!

  <h2 class="highlight">Fix my mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      The sad thing is, I thought I was already a recycling queen! For the last decade, I’ve been giving myself a 
      pat on the back for every garbage bag of milk cartons and water bottles I brought to the curb over the past 
      decade. Unfortunately, I did the bare minimum and would be willing to guess that the majority of my discard 
      ended up in a landfill. For example, I didn’t really clean anything and I tossed ALL plastic in without 
      checking to see if it was accepted. Sadly, <a href="#">wishful recycling</a> does more harm than good.
