    Big companies like Crest, Colgate, and Aquafresh are some of the world's leading suppliers of toothpaste. 
    This week's letter will ask them to phase out the plastic, use less toxins, and stop testing their 
    products on animals. Please feel free to use this template to send your own request for sustainable changes.
