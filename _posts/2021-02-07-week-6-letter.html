<section class="letter">
Good morning,

I hope you’re doing well. Diner Town is one of my favorite places to grab lunch; 
the pecan pie is my absolute fave! During my last visit, I couldn’t help but notice 
that straws are automatically placed in all of the drinks. 

Straws and single-use plastic in general have been getting a lot of media attention. 
France has done away with single-use plastic cups and cutlery so has Seattle. 
Even McDonald’s is looking for plastic straw alternatives. 

Straws may seem small, but it adds up. In the US alone, we use 500 million plastic straws everyday! 

Currently, 8 million tons of plastic winds up in the ocean each year. Most of that is single-use 
plastic which is responsible for killing over a 100,000 marine animals annually. 

I would like to ask that Diner Town, adopt a straw on request only policy. This means that 
straws aren’t automatically put into drinks or advertised. Instead, they are only handed out when 
a customer specifically asks for one. 

This will significantly decrease the amount of straws you go through having a positive 
affect on the environment and the bottom line. 

I really hope you’ll take my request under consideration. thank you! 

Sincerely, 

Kathryn
