  <h2 class="hightlight">Tooth Tablets</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to zero waste toothpaste, tablets are hands down my favorite. There is no gel or 
      liquid, which means they are travel friendly and don't make a mess like traditional toothpaste. 
      All you do is pop the tablet it in your mouth and chew until foamy, then you're ready to brush!

      <h4>1. Bite Toothpaste Bits</h4>

        <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/products/mint-subscription" target="__blank">
        Bite Toothpaste Bits</a> are my first choice for toothpaste tablets for multiple reasons. 
        The flavors, Fresh Mint, Berry Twist, and Mint Charcoal, all taste great. These bits come in 
        a recyclable glass jar with an aluminum lid and refills come in a backyard compostable baggie. 
        Bite bits are made from all natural ingredients and do not contain toxins like triclosan and fluoride. 
        And to top it off, Bite is vegan, meaning their products don't contain animal products 
        and cruelty-free, meaning they don't test products on animals. Bite Bits are $30 for 258 tablets if you 
        have a subscription.

  <h2 class="highlight">Tooth Powder</h2>
    <p>
      If you've ever brushed your teeth with baking soda, you know how tooth powder works. All you do is wet your 
      toothbrush, stick it in the powder, and brush your teeth normally.

      If you're looking to stay in the traditional toothpaste game, consider these options. Some come in a jar, 
      instead of a tube, so all you do is dip your brush or use a small spoon to apply the paste to your bristles.
