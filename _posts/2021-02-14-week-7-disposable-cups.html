<section>
  <p>I hope y'all are ready to kick your Tiny Waste resolution up a notch, because this week, we are giving up 
    disposable cups. Take minute to go through a typical week and think about how many times you encounter 
    the throw-away cup...cafes, restaurants, take out, fast food, gatherings...the little beasts are everywhere.
    Don't worry, we don't have say goodbye to Starbucks, we are just enjoying those thematic lattes without 
    producing quite as much waste.

  <h2 class="highlight">The Problem With Disposable Cups</h2>
  <p>I can't be the only one that notices all of the public trash cans overflowing with disposable cups. 
    And you know what? The trash can is exactly where they belong, since most aren't recyclable or compostable!
    Disposable cups are garbage that will go to a landfill and stay there for hundreds of years. 
  </p>
  <p>It's estimated that Americans alone throw away <a href="https://blog.epa.gov/tag/disposable-coffee-cup/" target="__blank">
    <strong>25 billion</strong></a> coffee cups every year. If we take a look at the resourcees it takes 
    just to make the little imps, that means: 
    <ul>
      <li>9.4 million trees harvested just for cups</li>
      <li>363 million pounds of waste were generated</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="highligh">COVID-19</h2>
  <p>Now, let me address the current pandemic and it's effect on disposable cups. As you know, big chains like 
    Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts put their reusable cup discount programs on hold to prevent the spread of Covid-19. 
    That could used as an excuse to put this week's resolution on hold, but
