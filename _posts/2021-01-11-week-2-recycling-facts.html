Only about 9% of plastic gets recycled
On a brighter note, aluminum, steel and glass are all infinitely recyclable, which means they can 
be recycled over and over again without a loss in quality or purity!

U.S. recycling levels are currently at 21.4%. 
When those levels reach 75%, it will equal taking approximately 55 million cars off the road for an entire year!

Americans throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour.
Recycling one ton of plastic bottles saves the equivalent energy usage of a two person household 
for one year.

More than 28 billion glass bottles and jars end up in landfills every year -- 
that is the equivalent of filling up two Empire State Buildings every three weeks.
Making glass from recycled material cuts related water pollution by 50%.

Americans throw away enough office paper each year to build a 12 foot high wall 
from Seattle to NY (a new wall every year).
Making paper from recycled paper reduces the related contribution to air pollution 95%.
