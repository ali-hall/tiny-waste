    When I was a little girl, I couldn't wait for makeup to be a part of my daily routine and by the time 
    I started high school, it was. I've never been a huge makeup fanatic, but I always wore the basics: 
    concealer, eye liner, mascara, and some sort of lip tint. I couldn't begin to guess how many little 
    plastic makeup containers I've gone through in the last twenty years, but I'm sure all together, it 
    would make a pretty disturbing pile of garbage.  <!--more-->

  <h2>Why is makeup a problem for the environment?</h2>
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/heres-what-the-average-american-woman-spends-on-makeup-and" target="__blank">
    one poll</a>, the average woman spends $300,000 on makeup over the course of her lifetime.

  <p>
    Plastics are problematic because they are made from non-renewable resources, have limited 
    recyclability, and take hundreds if not thousands of years to break down. 
    Hand soap and sanitizer bottles, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which is harmful for two reasons: 
    manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic breaks down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air.

  <h2>Are makeup containers recyclable?</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the majority of makeup containers are not curbside recyclable. Their mixed materials 
    cannot be separated properly and their small sizes often clog up the machinery. 
    You should only toss products into the recycling bin if you are 100% sure they are accepted to avoid <a href="wishful-recycling.html" target="__blank">wishful recycling</a>.
    Remember that the small recycling symbol on a container <em>does not</em> mean it is recyclable, it only indicates the type of material being used. With that number, 
    you can check your local requirements to see if it is accepted with curbside pickup.

    You can, however, send any beauty products to Terracycle for free via a recycling program in 
    partnership with <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/garnier#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">Garnier</a>. 
    Or, you can drop your cosmetics off at a participating <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/nordstrom" target="__blank">Nordstrom</a> 
    for recycling.

  <h2>How can I be more sustainable?</h2>
  <p>
    You can start by using what you have instead of throwing barely used cosmetics in the trash. 
    When it's time to replace your makeup, try a brand that offers low-waste, recyclable, and/or compostable 
    packaging as well as environmentally friendly ingredients. Read my next post for a list of <a href="sustainable-makeup-brands.html" target="__blank">
