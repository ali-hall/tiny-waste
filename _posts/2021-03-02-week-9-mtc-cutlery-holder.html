      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/1-pants.jpg"  alt="pair of worn out pants">
      <p>
        1. Grab an old pair of pants (or any scrap fabric). One pant leg was perfect for this project.
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/2-measure.jpg"  alt="knife, fork, spoon and straw lined up on pant leg">
      <p>
        2. Lay out your utensils to see how much fabric you need. It should be wide enough for all 
        of your utensils to fit side by side and double the height of your tallest piece. When opened, 
        my pant leg was about 19" x 8".
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/3-cut.jpg"  alt="a pant leg that has been cut off">
      <p>
        3. Cut the pant leg off.
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/4-cut-flap.jpg"  alt="cut in pant leg that opens the tube">
      <p>
        4. Cut only the top layer about 2/3 of the way up. 
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/5-cut-hem.jpg"  alt="rectangle of cut pant fabric with hem being removed">
      <p>
        5. Open the pant leg and cut the hem off. Don't throw it away, you'll need it later.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/6-pin-edges.jpg"  alt="short sides of pant fabric pinned down">
      <p>
        6. Pin the short sides of your fabric about a quarter of an inch on the wrong side and sew.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/7-pin-inside-out.jpg"  alt="material folded down and pinned ">
      <p>
        7. Lay your fabric wrong side down. Fold and pin each short side in, right sides touching. You can use your longest piece of cutlery as 
        a guide. I folded the top down about 3" and the bottom up about 4", leaving a 2" gap.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/8-sew.jpg"  alt="pant material sewn at folds">
      <p>
        8. Use a straight stitch to sew each pinned section.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/9-trim-corners.jpg"  alt="Scissors cutting off the corners of sewn pant fabric">
      <p>
        9. With the fabric still inside out, trim the corners.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/10-flip-and-pin.jpg"  alt="fabric gap pinned down">
      <p>
        10. Turn your fabric right side out. Pin and sew the edges of the gap fabric.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/11-measure.jpg"  alt="material being measured and marked with chalk">
      <p>
        11. Divide the bottom flap by the number of utensils you have. I used a straw, knife, fork, and spoon,
        so I wanted four pockets. Use chalk to mark the lines.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/12-sew-dividers.jpg"  alt="material with two flaps and four sewn dividers">
      <p>
        12. Straight stich each chalked line.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/13-attach-hem.jpg"  alt="hem strip being attached to side of the sewn material">
      <p>
        13. Grab the pant hem you previously cut off and sew the middle of it to either side of 
        your wrap.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/14-insert-utensils.jpg"  alt="utensils added to wrap">
      <p>
        14. Add your utensils, one in each pocket, then tuck them under the top flap.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/9-cutlery/15-roll-and-tie.jpg"  alt="finished cutlery wrap rolled up and tied">
      <p>
        15. Start rolling from the side without the tie, then use a half knot to keep your wrap 
        bundled.
      </p>
