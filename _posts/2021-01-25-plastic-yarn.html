      <p>
        1. Flatten your plastic bag.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/2-cut-bottom.jpg">
      <p>
        2. Fold the bag in half hot dog style and cut the bottom seam off.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/3-cut-top.jpg">
      <p>
        3. With the bag still folded, cut the top handles off.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>

      <p>
        4. Spread the bag out to find a tube shape and flatten.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/5-fold-up.jpg">
      <p>
        5. Fold the closed edge up about an inch below the  other closed edge.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/6-cut-strips.jpg">
      <p>
        6. Cut half inch strips starting from the fold and going just past the edge of the top layer.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/7-cut-all.jpg">
      <p>
        7. Continue cutting strips until you've reached the other end of the bag. 
        They don't need to be perfect.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/8-find-tube.jpg">
      <p>
        8. Find your tube the same way you did in step 4.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/9-find-spine.jpg">
      <p>
        9. Put a piece of cardboard or anything to help keep your tube orderly.
        You should have what looks like a spine on top.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/10-diagonal-cuts.jpg">
      <p>
        10. Make diagonal cuts going from the right edge of your bottom strips, to the right edge
        of it's neighboring top strip.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/plastic-bags/11-roll-plarn.jpg">
      <p>
        11. When all of your diagonal cuts are made, you should have one continuous strip. Roll it up
        as you would regular yarn.
      </p>
    </li>

        You've saved a bag from the landfill, now go forth and make something with your new plarn!
